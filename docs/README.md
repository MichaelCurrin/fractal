# Documentation

<!-- Note to self - while docs this directory could be added as pages on the site, the local links would break. So focus the site on just being a one-page demo. -->

## Purpose

I found myself writing the same modifications on top of the Minima theme across my projects, so I made my own theme to put everything in one place.

I use this theme in these Jekyll sites, where collect and write content around coding. See these links for a demo of how this theme works in a larger site.
