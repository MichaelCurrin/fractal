    Embed SVG directly on page to save a fetch of each directly.

    It is possible to put all SVGs in a single file and use IDs, but this
    is extra work to build the pipeline esp as the SVG files have to have frontmatter to be picked up. Also this way means that a bad logo is picked up immediately, rather than looking up a possible ID in a single SVG.

    Required args:
        name: SVG name excluding extension. e.g. 'ansible'.

    Optional args:
        _size: 'small' or 'medium'.

{% assign _size = include._size | default: 'small' %}
{% assign svg_path = include.name | prepend: 'logos/' | append: '.svg' %}

<div class="logo-{{ _size }}">
    {% include {{ svg_path }} %}
</div>
