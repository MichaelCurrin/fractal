    Embed SVG directly on page to save a fetch of each directly.

    It is possible to put all SVGs in a single file and use IDs, but this
    is extra work to build the pipeline esp as the SVG files have to have frontmatter to be picked up. Also this way means that a bad logo is picked up immediately, rather than looking up a possible ID in a single SVG.

    Note that the minus signs are needed for the logo to be used alone outside of tags, even if if the include is not indented.

    Required args:
        name: SVG name excluding extension. e.g. 'ansible'.

    Optional args:
        _size: 'small' or 'medium'.

{% assign _size = include._size | default: 'small' %}
{% assign svg_path = include.name | prepend: 'logos/' | append: '.svg' %}

<span class="logo-{{ _size }}">
    {%- include {{ svg_path }} -%}
</span>
